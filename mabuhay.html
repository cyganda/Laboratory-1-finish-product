<h3> BARO'T SAYA </h3>

<p> The <strong>barong tagalog</strong>, more commonly known simply as <em>barong</em> (and occasionally <em>baro</em>), 
is an embroidered long-sleeved formal shirt for men and a national dress of the Philippines. 
Barong tagalog combines elements from both the precolonial native Filipino and colonial Spanish clothing styles. 
It is traditionally made with sheer textiles (nipis) woven from piÃ±a or abacÃ¡; although in modern times, 
cheaper materials like silk, ramie, or polyester are also used.

It is a common formal or semi-formal attire in Filipino culture, and is worn untucked over an undershirt with belted trousers and dress shoes. 
<strong> Baro't saya </strong> is the feminine equivalent of barong tagalog, with the Maria Clara gown being the formal variant of the latter. 
Barong tagalog was also known as camisa fuera <em>("outer shirt")</em> in Spanish. </p>

<h3>BAKYA</h3>
<p>
The national footwear of the Philippines is wooden clogs with a plastic strap and called <strong>â€˜bakya.â€™</strong>
Bakya were made from local light wood e.g. santol and laniti. 
These were cut to the desired foot size before being shaven until smooth. The side of the bakya was thick enough to be carved with floral, 
geometric or landscape designs. 
Afterwards, the bakya were painted or varnished. Uppers of plastic or rubber were fastened using <em>clavitos</em> (tiny nails).
